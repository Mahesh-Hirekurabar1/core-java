1.Constructor-"It is a block of code which is execute when object is created"
 Constructor-can be created same as the class name
 we have 3 rules in constructor
 1.Constructor name should be same as class name.
 2.no explicite return type
 3.Don't use static and final key word
 for example: public class Bus{
				Public static void main(String[] args){
				
				public Bus(){
				//Statement
				}
				}
				}
				
				
 2.Types of constructor
  we have two types
  1.Default constructor:-  default constructor is created by the explicite type when it is exicuted./it 
  -is automatically created by the compiler when class file will be exicuted.
   default constructor not have any parameters 
   it is explicite type constructor.
   Syntax:Public static void main(String[] args){
				//Default constructor
				public Bus(){
				//Statement
				}
				}
				}
  2.parameterized constructor:-it is created by the user having the parametersinside it.
  when ever object is created we need to create constructor
  constructoris also createdto initialize the values.
 Public static void main(String[] args){
				int age;
				public Bus(Parameters){
				//Statement
				}
				}
				}
				
				
3.Object
object is a keyword it represents the states and behaviours
where states are the characterstic of the object
behaviours is the action of the object
 objects are route of class
 if we have similar type of behaviours then we use static keyword.
 this will helps to memory save
 and it is immutable
 
 
 
4.class
class is the road map or blue print for create an object
*class give the flow of program



5.Method Overloading
Method overloading is same in method name but different in parameter
3 ways for create the method overloading
1.Changing no.of parameters 
2.Changing the Datatype of parameter
3.Changing the order of parameters




6.Variables 
Variables are the container to store the values of data type
for example: int stores the integer values
Syntax: dataType variableName or referenceName =  value;
int ageOfRohit=23;


7.This is the keyword
it is used when parameterized constructorwill be creating 
it will helpes to differentiate between variableName
syntax:
public Human(int age){
 this.age=age;
 }



8.String
String is keyword which is use to store the group of chracters.
*String is immutable
in string we can write by type
1.litterals
2.By using new keyword
for example:- String name="Mahesh";
String name = new String();



9.methods of String class
1.charAt(char   ch);
	charAtis the string method type which return the char values
	it is inbuilt function in java.
2.split();
	this type of string metho is used to split the and it returns the string values
		this is also inbuilt function used to split the sentences ,etc
3.toUpperCase();
	this type of string it will execute uppercase chracters in sentences.
4.toLowerCase();
this type of string it will execute lowercase chracters in sentences.
5.



10.String is immutable
Strings in Java are immutable because strings with the same content share storage in a string pool 
to avoid the same copy of the value.
if 1st value is stored in string pool it take one address location after that another string is pass with different 
parameter it automatically go for new address and old one is vanished. so string is immutable it con't be modify.
